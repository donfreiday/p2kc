What is it
==========

P2KC is a tool to communicate with Motorola P2K phones.

Supported devices:
 * Motorola RAZRÂ² v9
 * This list is very incomplete. Please test and report if your phone works.

This code was originally developped for "P2K Commander" and open sourced by
Sandor Otvos. Thanks for this, it is very useful!

These mobile phones implement a configurable USB interface and can be used as
an AT Modem (over USB-CDC), an USB LAN adapter, a mass storage device (exposing
the SD card contents), a recovery "flash" mode, and P2K mode.

In P2K mode, the phone receives and replies to commands. This mode can be used
to access the phone internal memory as well as the SD card. It is more reliable
than the SD card mode because it avoids sharing the filesystem between the phone
and the computer accessing it (a sure way to corrupt the filesystem from my
experience).

Tools provided
==============

p2k-core
--------

There is a simple tool called p2k-core with an interactive command line
interface. This implements the P2K protocol and communicates with the phone. It
is highly portable and needs only libusb, readline, and ncurses.

p2kc
----

p2kc is a file-manager-like UI shell for p2k-core. It uses GTK for user
interface, and communicates with p2k-core through pipes to send commands and
receive results.
